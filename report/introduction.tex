The aim of this coursework is to implement a Fully-Connected Neural Network from scratch and train it in order to identify the best parameters according to emition recognition. \\

To do so we implemented first all the necessary keystones function to create the Network such as: \\
	- Linear and ReLu Layers \\
	- Dropout Layers \\
	- SoftMax Classifiers \\

Finally we implemented hyper-parameter optimisation in order to train our Network.\\
In this report we will explain and discuss choices we made on our function implementation and the results we got from the training.
