The aim of this coursework is to implement and train a fully connected neural net to classifiy emotions using images of faces.
There are 7 emotions, namely: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise and neutral.
This report discusses our approach and findings.
First, we discuss the theory behind neural nets.
Next, we explain how we tuned our neural net's hyperparameters
and provide an analysis of our model using metrics such as confusion matrices or recall rates.
We conclude with an exploration of neural net state of the art exploration and limitations.
