In order to tune the hyperparameters, we began by exploring reasonable network architectures, and hyperparameters using a grid search.
Our end goal was to use random search to find optimal hyperparameters but we wanted to get a better idea of each hyperparameter's domain.
Using grid search, we narrowed down the ranges.
